# Introduction

This is a practice project for me to play around with deploying a CI/CD pipeline comprising of a frontend React web app and a .NET core web API, through Github actions and Azure.

## Running the project locally

```zsh
# Enter the parent directory that contains the frontend and backend repositories
1. cd folder-name

# Make the script executable
2. chmod +x start.sh

# Run the script to start both repositories
3. ./start.sh
```
