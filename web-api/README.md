## Local development

```zsh
dotnet watch --launch-profile https
```

Scaffolded by following [this tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-9.0&tabs=visual-studio-code). The only difference is I used the [Scalar package](https://github.com/scalar/scalar/blob/main/packages/scalar.aspnetcore/README.md) instead of Swagger for documenting the API.
